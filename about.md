I am a Research Associate at the University of Cambridge. My research focuses on measurements of the cosmology of the early universe and the first stars and development of novel Bayesian data analysis techniques to achieve these measurements.

I have a particular focus on 21cm cosmology. This is a field of research that leverages the emission line of neutral hydrogen at 21cm in order to probe the history of the very early universe. Measuring the redshifted absorption or emission of this spectral line can reveal details both of the properties and behaviour of the very first stars and galaxies, as well as the cosmology and development of the early universe during the as-yet unexplored 'Dark Ages' before those first stars formed.

My primary research is on developing new Bayesian data analyis tools for performing these early universe measurements. During my PhD, I led the development of the forward modelling Bayesian data analysis pipeline of the Global 21cm experiment [REACH (the Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01709-9). For  I also helped guide the experimental design of REACH though simulations of this foreward modelling process.

I also work on the [Square Kilometre Array (SKA)](https://www.skao.int/). My primary research in this area is to characterise the effects of mutual coupling between antennas using state-of-the-art simulation tools and aid in optimising the design of the SKA-LOW in light of these effects.

I also work on developing addtional novel Bayesian tools, such as a method of efficient RFI mitigation or transient detection using likelihood reweighting.
